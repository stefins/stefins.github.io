Hi, Stefin here! You can call me Stef!  I'm basically from Kerala, India but staying in Bangalore,India for the past 3 years.

Welcome to my personal webpage.

I have 3+ Years of experience working with computers. I started out as a front-end developer who primarily worked in React. After trying front-end for 4 months I took the leap to become a back-end developer. I started Full Stack web development with Django. After that I learned Go, which transformed my entire understanding of computers. Then I started writing high performant modern multi-threaded applications using Go.

As time proceeded I found my interest moving away from Go to Rust for Low level programming. In my time with Rust I worked with High performant safe programs that have used modern synchronization primitives. After getting comfortable in Rust I rewrote one of my hobby project from Python to [Rust](https://github.com/stefins/wdcrypt)

After getting comfortable in low level system level concepts I got interested in GNU/Linux. I tinkered with various low level operating system and got interested in system level programming. I read the Linux Kernel Development book and got more interested in Linux.

That's it for now! The journey never stops :)
